I"ê<h2 id="extra-credit">Extra Credit</h2>

<p>Write an exam question that would be appropriate for your midterm exam. This question should be fairly rigorous; the amount of extra credit given will reflect the rigor of your question. Your question must come from material covered during the first four weeks of class. It may be in whatever format you deem appropriate. To receive full credit, <em>you must write an original question</em> and you must provide a complete solution. Where appropriate, you must show your work - this work may be submitted in the form of a scan or photo of your handwritten solution.</p>

<p>Your completed exam question must be submitted on iLearn (‚ÄúMidterm Exam Extra Credit‚Äù under ‚ÄúAssignments‚Äù) by 11:59PM on October 25. As this is extra credit, there will be a zero tolerance policy for late work.</p>

<p>Note: extra credit will be applied to your midterm exam score.</p>
