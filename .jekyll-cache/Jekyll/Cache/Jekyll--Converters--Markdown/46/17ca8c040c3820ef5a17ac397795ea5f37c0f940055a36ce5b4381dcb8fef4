I"ª<h2 id="extra-credit">Extra Credit</h2>

<p>Write an exam question that would be appropriate for your final exam (<em>Note: the final exam is not cumulative</em>). This question should be fairly rigorous; the amount of extra credit given will reflect the rigor of your question. Your question must come from material covered during the final six weeks of class. It may be in whatever format you deem appropriate. To receive full credit, <em>you must write an original question</em> and you must provide a complete solution. Where appropriate, you must show your work - this work may be submitted in the form of a scan or photo of your handwritten solution.</p>

<p>Your completed exam question must be submitted on iLearn (‚ÄúFinal Exam Extra Credit‚Äù under ‚ÄúAssignments‚Äù) by 11:59PM on December 9. As this is extra credit, there will be a zero tolerance policy for late work.</p>

<p>Note: extra credit will be applied to your final exam score.</p>
