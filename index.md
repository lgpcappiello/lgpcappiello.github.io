I am an Assistant Professor in the Mathematics and Statistics Department at CSU, Sacramento. My background is in statistics and I recieved my PhD in Applied Statistics from the University of California, Riverside. 

My goal for this site is to share teaching materials and information on my research. Course materials may be found under "Teaching", with original LaTeX and markdown files on my Github. I am always open to collaboration and mentoring student research and am happy to work on projects outside of the current scope of my research. I also do consulting work as time permits. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions.
