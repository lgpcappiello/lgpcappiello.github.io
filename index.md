Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in the Mathematics and Statistics Department at CSU, Sacramento. My research interests include biostatistics and applied statistics, particularly in biological and social science fields. 

Selected course materials may be found under "Teaching", with original LaTeX and markdown files on my Github. I am always open to collaboration and mentoring student research and am happy to work on projects outside of the current scope of my research. I also do consulting work as time permits. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions. 

## About

As a college student, I went to six different colleges and universities, switched majors countless times, and finally graduated after five years. I started college wanting to be an opera singer and starred in a <a href="https://vimeo.com/32599888" target="_blank">condensed version of Leonard Bernstein's Trouble in Tahiti</a>. Later I spent a summer doing wildlife care at the <a href="https://highdesertmuseum.org/wildlife/" target="_blank">High Desert Museum in Central Oregon</a>. Eventually I landed in Statistics and went on to do my PhD in Applied Statistics at UC Riverside. Not every path from A to Z is a straight line and I encourage students to take their time and explore. :)

I ended up in statistics because I love solving puzzles and learning about everything (and talking to everyone). When I'm not working, I'm an enthusiastic tabletop gamer and I usually have several <a href="https://lgpcappiello.github.io/Crafting-Projects/">unfinished crafting projects</a> laying around. I also love animals and have a <a href="https://lgpcappiello.github.io/Meet-the-Rescues/">growing menagerie of rescues</a>.
