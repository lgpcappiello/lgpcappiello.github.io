## Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor in the Mathematics and Statistics Department at CSU, Sacramento. My background is in statistics and I received my PhD in Applied Statistics from UC, Riverside. My research interests include biostatistics and applied statistics, particularly in biological and social science fields. 

When I'm not working, I'm an enthusiastic tabletop gamer and I usually have several <a href="https://lgpcappiello.github.io/Crafting-Projects/">unfinished crafting projects</a> laying around. I also love animals and have a <a href="https://lgpcappiello.github.io/Meet-the-Rescues/">growing menagerie of rescues</a>. 

Selected course materials may be found under "Teaching", with original LaTeX and markdown files on my Github. I am always open to collaboration and mentoring student research and am happy to work on projects outside of the current scope of my research. I also do consulting work as time permits. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions.
