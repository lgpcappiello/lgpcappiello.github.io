I am an Assistant Professor in the Mathematics and Statistics Department at CSU, Sacramento. My background is in statistics and I received my PhD in Applied Statistics from UC, Riverside. I'm passionate about undergraduate education and am particularly interested in equity in service-level mathematics and statistics courses. For more frequent, informal updates, I am also active on <a href="https://twitter.com/lgpcappiello" target="blank">Twitter</a>.

My goal for this site is to share teaching materials and information on my research. Course materials may be found under "Teaching", with original LaTeX and markdown files on my Github. I am always open to collaboration and mentoring student research and am happy to work on projects outside of the current scope of my research. I also do consulting work as time permits. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions.
