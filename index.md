## Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor in the Mathematics and Statistics Department at CSU, Sacramento. My background is in statistics and I received my PhD in Applied Statistics from UC, Riverside. My research interests include applied projects, particularly in biological and social science fields, and higher education, especially when it comes to getting students excited about statistics! I'm particularly interested in data/statistics ethics, both in the questions themselves and in bringing conversations about ethics into the statisitcs classroom. 

When I'm not working, I am an enthusiastic tabletop gamer and am slowly making my way back into the world of powerlifting after an extended haitus (thanks, graduate school!). I also *love* animals and have a growing menagerie of rescues. <a href="https://lgpcappiello.github.io/Meet-the-Rescues/">You can read about them here</a>. For informal updates, dog/cat photos, and bad jokes, I am also (semi) active on <a href="https://twitter.com/lgpcappiello" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.

My goal for this site is to share teaching materials and information on my research. Course materials may be found under "Teaching", with original LaTeX and markdown files on my Github. I am always open to collaboration and mentoring student research and am happy to work on projects outside of the current scope of my research. I also do consulting work as time permits. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions. 

### Curriculum Vitae
