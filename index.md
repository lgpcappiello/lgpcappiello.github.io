Incoming Assistant Professor in the Mathematics and Statistics Department at CSU, Sacramento. Current Applied Statistics Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Riverside. My dissertation research focuses on applying semi-parametric / machine learning methods to adjusting for population differences. One such problem involves inferring treatment effects when placebo-controlled trials are not available in the current population. This can occur, for example, when there are ethical concerns related to withholding treatment.

Course materials may be found under "Teaching", with original LaTeX and markdown files on my Github.
