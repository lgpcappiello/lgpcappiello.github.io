# About

Applied Statistics Ph.D. candidate with strong written and oral communication skills. My research focuses on applying semi-parametric / machine learning methods to evidence synthesis problems in causal inference. In plain language, this involves inferring treatment effects when placebo-controlled trials are not available in the current population. This can occur, for example, when there are ethical concerns related to withholding treatment.

Always on the lookout for new ways to learn and get involved, I am the president of the Statistics Department Graduate Student Association and of Mu Sigma Rho (a national statistics honors society) at UCR. In these roles, I am focused on community building and professional development opportunities for students. Currently I am excited about progress being made in developing a graduate student seminar, creating stronger social ties within the department, and developing a department newsletter. 

I am also the primary instructor for Introduction to Statistics II, for which I am developing materials including lectures and labs, managing several TAs, and piloting the use of R programming in the department's introductory statistics courses. Much of my course materials may be found under "Teaching", with original LaTex and markdown files on my Github.
