# About

Applied Statistics Ph.D. candidate working under the supervision of Dr. Xinping Cui at the University of California, Riverside with support from Dr. Zhiwei Zhang at the NCI. I am especially interested in biostatistics, specifically in pharmacy and medicine. My research focuses on applying machine learning methods to evidence synthesis problems in causal inference.
