<h2 id="welcome">Welcome!</h2>

<p>I am an Assistant Professor in the Mathematics and Statistics Department at CSU, Sacramento. My background is in statistics and I received my PhD in Applied Statistics from UC, Riverside. My research interests include biostatistics and applied statistics, particularly in biological and social science fields.</p>

<p>When I’m not working, I’m an enthusiastic tabletop gamer and I usually have several unfinished crafting projects laying around. I also love animals and have a growing menagerie of rescues. <a href="https://lgpcappiello.github.io/Meet-the-Rescues/">You can read about them here</a>. For informal updates, dog/cat photos, and bad jokes, I am also (semi) active on <a href="https://twitter.com/lgpcappiello" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Selected course materials may be found under “Teaching”, with original LaTeX and markdown files on my Github. I am always open to collaboration and mentoring student research and am happy to work on projects outside of the current scope of my research. I also do consulting work as time permits. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions.</p>
