## Daisy

My husband and I adopted Daisy in 2011. I was volunteering at a low cost spay and neuter clinic helping out with surgical recovery. Someone found her and brought her in with her four kittens. Daisy is 10 or 11 now (winter 2021) and spends most of her days sleeping at the top of the cat tree.

## Fiddler

A couple of friends started feeding a stray cat that wandered into their yard in early 2017. A couple months later she had four kittens in their upstairs closet. We took this perfect floofy angel off their hands. Fiddler is super friendly but won't hesitate to knock your glassware off the counter.

## Suki

We rescued Suki after moving to Sacramento in summer 2020. I found her on Craigslist. The guy who got rid of her had a newborn and was keeping her outside all the time because he didn't know how to manage such a high energy dog. She's an Austrailian cattle dog mix - a smart, eager-to-please, high-energy breed! She loves to learn and we do a lot of little tricks with her. We named her after a character in Avatar the Last Airbender.

## Sokka

We got Sokka from Sacramento Independent Animal Rescuers in January 2021. He loves to snuggle. He came to us very shy, but we spent some time working with a trainer to get his confidence up. He's doing great, but he probably won't ever be excited about new people. Sokka is also named after Avatar the Last Airbender, but we didn't name him! The rescue named him and he came to us (and to Suki!) with his name. My sister found him for us on Petfinder and it felt like fate :)

## The Turtles

Two red-eared sliders came home with me (as tiny babies) from Chinatown in Los Angeles circa 2014. The friend I'd gone to LA with passed away unexpectedly in 2017 and they're a sweet reminder of her.
