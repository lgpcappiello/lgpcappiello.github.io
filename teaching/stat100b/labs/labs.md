# R Labs for STAT 100B

## Logging In

To log on to the computer, click or press any button. A log on information box should appear. Your log on information is your NetID and permanent PIN. If you have changed your webmail password, you may need to use that password instead of your permanent PIN. This will log you onto a personal account on the computer. You should not need multifactor authentication for this process. If necessary, you can reset your UCR password using a phone or tablet by going to password.ucr.edu. The first time you log on to a lab computer, it may take a few minutes to set up your account. This is normal!

If you are unable to log on even after resetting your password and talking to your TA, you may visit Student Computing Services in Watkins 2117.  

## Using R

R is already installed on the lab computers. There should be an R icon on the Desktop (it may be labeled R x64 3.2.5 or something similar). You may also use RStudio, a useful GUI for working with R. We will work directly in the R Console, which will appear when you open R or RStudio. 

Alternately, open up a web browser and navigate to <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/projects" target="blank">rstudio.cloud/projects</a>. This is an online version of RStudio. You will need to create a (free) account to use this website, but this will allow you to save your work in the cloud. If you are having any issues using R or RStudio on the lab computers, this should fix those issues. To access the RStudio console, click on "new project" or click on one of your existing projects to continue working.

If you want to spend time working with R at home, I recommend getting started by using RStudio in the cloud. Eventually, you may want to <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="blank">download R</a>. You may also want to <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/" target="blank">download RStudio</a>. Both R and RStudio are free to download and use.

## Turning in Labs

Each lab has several "Exercise" problems and at least one "On Your Own" section, all of which should be included in your wite-up. Lab write-ups must include the original question, the R code used to produce your results, and a thorough response for each problem (including the R output!). All parts of your write up must be typed. Feel free to copy and paste the original questions from the lab documents. Plots and images should be included by copy and pasting or by screen shot. A printed copy of your lab must be turned in to your TA by the end of your Lab B. Because you have several days to finish each lab, there is a zero tolerance policy for late labs.  

## Help

For help during lab, raise your hand and ask your TA. For questions outside of lab, please feel free to come to office hours, email the instructor or your TA, find one of us before or after class, or stop us on the street. :)
