## Midterm Topics
### The midterm may not cover everything, but every one of these topics is fair game.

- Hypothesis tests for paired samples
- Hypothesis tests for two-sample means
- Sample size calculations for two-sample means
- ANOVA tables and their interpretation (one-way, two-way, factorial)
  - Hypotheses
  - Assumptions
  - Relationships between cells in an ANOVA table
  - Interactions between factors
  - Appropriate conclusions
- Multiple comparisons
  - Bonferroni correction
  - Tukey's method
- Experimental design (when to use each design)
  - completely randomized
  - randomized block
  - factorial
  
Note: Previous quizzes are a good example of how I approach test questions.
