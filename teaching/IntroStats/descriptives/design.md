<p>When we do research, we have two options:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Conduct an&nbsp;<strong>experiment</strong>, where researchers assign treatments to cases.&nbsp;
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Treatments </strong>are experimental conditions.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>In an experiment, cases may also be called&nbsp;<strong>experimental units</strong> (items or individuals on which the experiment is performed).</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Conduct an&nbsp;<strong>observational study</strong>, where no conditions are assigned. These are often done for ethical reasons, like examining the impacts of smoking cigarettes. Can you think of another example?</li>
</ol>
<p>Experiments allow us to infer&nbsp;<em>causation</em>. Observational studies do not.</p>
<p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Experimental design principles:</span>
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Control</strong>: two or more treatments are compared.</li>
    <li><strong>Randomization</strong>: experimental units are assigned to treatment groups (usually and preferably at random).</li>
    <li><strong>Replication</strong>: a large enough sample size is used to test each treatment many times (on many different experimental units).&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>Blocking</strong>: if variables other than treatment are likely to have an impact on study outcome, we use blocks.
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>For example, I might separate patients in a medical study into "high risk" and "low risk" blocks. I would randomly assign all of the high risk patients to a treatment and then randomly assign all of the low risk patients to a treatment.</li>
            <li>This helps ensure an even distribution of high/low risk patients in each treatment group.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>An experiment without blocking has a&nbsp;<strong>completely randomized design; a</strong>n experiment with blocking has a <strong>randomized block design.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In an experimental setting, we talk about</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Response variable</strong>: the characteristic of the experimental outcome being measured or observed.</li>
    <li><strong>Factor:</strong> a variable whose impact on the response variable is of interest in the experiment.</li>
    <li><strong>Levels</strong>: the possible values of a factor.</li>
    <li><strong>Treatment:&nbsp;</strong>each experimental condition (based on combinations of factor levels).</li>
</ul>
<p>In human subjects research, we do a little extra work:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If subjects do not know what treatment group they are in, the study is called&nbsp;<strong>blind.</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>We use a placebo (fake treatment) to achieve this.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If neither subject nor the researchers who interact with them know the treatment group, it is&nbsp;<strong>double blind.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This helps avoid bias (placebo effect, doctor's expectations for outcome, etc.)!</p>
