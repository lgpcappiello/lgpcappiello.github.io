Introduction to Data

What is statistics? There are two ways to think about this:

Facts and data, organized or summarized in such a way that they provide useful information about something.
The science of analyzing, organizing, and summarizing data.
As a field, Statistics provides tools for scientists, practitioners, and laypeople to better understand data. You may find yourself using knowledge from this course in a research lab, while reading a research report, or even while watching the news!
