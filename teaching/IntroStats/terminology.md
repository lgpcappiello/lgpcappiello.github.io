There are two ways to think about statistics:

1. **Descriptive statistics** are methods for *describing* information.

For example, 66% of eligible voters voted in the 2020 presidential election (the highest turnout since 1900!).

2. **Inferential statistics** are methods for *drawing inference* (making decisions about something we are uncertain about).

For example, a poll suggests that 75% of voters will select a Candidate A. People haven't voted yet, so we don't know what will happen, but we could reasonably conclude that Candidate A will win the election.

**Data** is factual information. We collect data from a **population**, the collection of all individuals or items a researcher is interested in.

- Collecting data from an entire population is called a **census**.
  - This is complicated and expensive! There's a reason the United States only does a census every 10 years.
- We can also take a **sample**, a subset of the population we get data from.
  - If you think of the population as a pie, the sample is a small slice. If it's a good pie, the small slice will tell you that.
