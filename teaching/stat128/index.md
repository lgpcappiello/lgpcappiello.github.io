This page is a work in progress. Selected course materials for Stat 128 (Fall 2022) will be added here.

## Labs

Class time is spent working through labs, so these also serve as a scaffolded version of the course notes.

1. [Introduction to R, RStudio, and RMarkdown](https://lgpcappiello.github.io/teaching/stat128/rmarkdown/1-Intro-to-R.html)
2. [Vectors](https://lgpcappiello.github.io/teaching/stat128/rmarkdown/2-Vectors.html)

The original RMarkdown files can be found [here](https://github.com/lgpcappiello/lgpcappiello.github.io/tree/master/teaching/stat128/rmarkdown).
