## Labs

Class is presented as a hands-on workthrough of each lab. Labs borrow heavily from work by [Rebecca Kurtz-Garcia](https://rpkgarcia.github.io/rpkgarcia/). 

1. [Introduction to R, RStudio, and RMarkdown](https://lgpcappiello.github.io/teaching/stat128/rmarkdown/1-Intro-to-R.html)
2. [Vectors and Factors](https://lgpcappiello.github.io/teaching/stat128/rmarkdown/2-Vectors.html)
3. [Lists](https://lgpcappiello.github.io/teaching/stat128/rmarkdown/3-Lists.html)

Original RMarkdown files can be found [here](https://github.com/lgpcappiello/lgpcappiello.github.io/tree/master/teaching/stat128/rmarkdown).
