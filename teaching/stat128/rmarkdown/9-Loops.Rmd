Loops let us tell R to run a series of commands multiple times. R has two types of loops: `while` and `for`. 

## While Loops

A `while` loop performs a task until a particular condition is no longer met. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
while( condition ){
  this
  code 
  chunk
  will 
  not
  run
}
```

- `condition` is any logical statement. 
    - While it is `TRUE`, the loop will continue to repeat. 
    - When it becomes `FALSE`, the loop will finish its current iteration and stop.

With `while` loops, it is very important to make sure that something in the loop will cause the condition to (eventually) become `FALSE`! Otherwise your loop will continue to run forever.

This loop saves the first 20 Fibonacci numbers:

```{r}
fibs <- c(0, 1)
itr <- 2

while(itr <= 20){ 
  itr <- itr+1
  fibs <- append(fibs, fibs[itr-1]+fibs[itr-2])
}
fibs
```

Note that if the condition is false at the start, the loop will never run.

```{r}
x <- 0
while(x == 2){
  print("loops")
}
```

Another thing that can be frustrating about `while` loops is that they don't stop as soon as the condition becomes false, they stop when the condition is false AND the commands within the loop reach the end. Say I want to print out all Fibonacci numbers under 200. I might try:

```{r}
fibs <- c(0, 1)
itr <- 2

while(fibs[itr] < 200){ # while(fibs[itr] + fibs[itr-1] < 200){ # 
  itr <- itr+1
  fibs <- append(fibs, fibs[itr-1]+fibs[itr-2])
}
fibs
```

But this condition is only false after I've hit the number 233, which has already been added to the vector. This needs to be reworked in order to run properly.  

### On Your Own

Use a `while` loop to print out 5, then 4, then 3, then 2, then 1.

```{r}
x <- 5

# while loop

```

## For Loops

The `for` statement in R is more flexible than in other programming languages. It will iterate over any type of items in a vector or list (in the order they appear in the vector).

```{r eval=FALSE}
for(var in iterable){
  this
  code 
  chunk
  will 
  not
  run
}
```

Here, `var` is the variable that takes on - one-by-one - the items in `iterable`.

Iterature through a vector:

```{r}
# Iterate through a vector
colors <- c("red","green","blue","yellow")

for (x in colors) {
  print(x)
}
```
Iterate through a list:

```{r}
lst <- list(3.14, "Hi", c(1,2,3))

for (i in lst) {
  print(i)
}
```
Print 'Hello!' 3 times using a sequence:

```{r}
for (x in 1:3) {
  print("Hello!")
}
```

Use another type of sequencing:

```{r}
for (x in seq(from=2,to=8,by=2)) {
  print(x^2)
}
```

Different people have different needs and preferences, but when I have to write a loop, I almost always find myself writing `for` loops over a sequence of numbers.

### On Your Own

Use a `for` loop to store the first 10 Fibonacci numbers in a vector, `fibs`. You may want to use the first `while` loop example to get started. 

```{r}
fibs <- numeric(10) # empty numeric vector of length 10

## For loop goes here ## 

```

## Breaks

The break statement is used to exit the loop immediately. The program continues after the loop.

```{r}
x <- 5

# If statement starts as TRUE,  the loop will never run 
while (x != 0 ) {
  print(x)
  x = x - 1
  
  if(x == 2){
    print("Entered IF statement, stop loop")
    break 
  }
  
}
```

If not given an adequate stopping criteria or `break` statement the loop will continue forever. For example, if we started the above example at x = -2. The `break` statement is particularly important for `while` loops, but can also be used in `for` loops. However, `for` loops have virtually no risk of running indefinitely.

```{r}
colors <- c("red","green","blue","yellow")
for (x in colors) {
  if (x == "blue"){
       break 
  }
  print(x)
}
```

### On Your Own

While it may not be ideal, one way to "fix" a difficult `while` loop is to throw a break in there. Use a `break` to stop the following loop from storing Fibonacci numbers greater than 200. 

```{r}
fibs <- c(0, 1)
itr <- 2

while(fibs[itr] < 200){
  itr <- itr+1
  fibs <- append(fibs, fibs[itr-1]+fibs[itr-2])
}
fibs
```


## Next

We can use a `next` command in loops in order to skip executing a command.

```{r}
for(i in 1:10){
  
  i <- i^2
  
  if(i <5){
    next
  }
  
  print(i)
}
```

The code runs until it hits the `next` statement, at which point it moves directly to the next iteration of the loop. In this case, it will not print when i=1 or when i=4, but it will continue the loop so that the rest of the iterations will print their results. 

### On Your Own

Use a `next` to stop the following loop from storing Fibonacci numbers greater than 200. 

```{r}
fibs <- c(0, 1)
itr <- 2

while(fibs[itr] < 200){
  itr <- itr+1
  fibs <- append(fibs, fibs[itr-1]+fibs[itr-2])
}
fibs
```

## Nested Loops

Loops in loops in loops

```{r}
for(i in 4:6){
  for(j in 1:3){
    statement = paste("i=", i, ", j=", j)
    print(statement)
  }
}
```

These are especially good for iterating through matrices

```{r}
mymat <- matrix(nrow=5, ncol=5)
mymat

for(i in 1:5){
  for(j in 1:5){
    mymat[i,j] <- i*j
  }
}
mymat
```
