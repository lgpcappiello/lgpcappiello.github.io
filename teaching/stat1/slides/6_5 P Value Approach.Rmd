If the null hypothesis is true, what is the probability of getting a random sample that is as inconsistent with the null hypothesis as the random sample we got? 

- This probability is called the **p-value**.

## Idea

- Probability of a sample *as inconsistent* as our sample is $$P(t_{df} \text{ is as extreme as the test statistic})$$
- Something like $P(t_{18} > 3.6) = 0.001$
    - ...but we want to think about the probability of being "as extreme" in *either direction*, so $$\text{p-value} = 2P(t_{18}>3.6) = 0.002$$

If $\text{p-value} < \alpha$, reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, do not reject. 

## P-Values 

- **Large Sample Setting**: $\mu$ is target parameter, $n \ge 30$, $$2P(Z > |z|)$$ where $z$ is the test statistic.

- **Small Sample Setting**: $\mu$ is target parameter, $n < 30$, $$2P(t_{df} > |t|)$$ where $t$ is the test statistic.

## Steps

1. State the null and alternative hypotheses.
2. Determine the significance level $\alpha$. Check assumptions (decide which setting to use).
3. Compute the value of the test statistic.
4. Determine the p-value.
5. If $\text{p-value} < \alpha$, reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, do not reject.
6. Interpret results. 

We often use p-values instead of the critical value approach because they are meaningful on their own (they have a direct interpretation).

## Example

Is the average mercury level in dolphin muscles different from $2.5\mu g/g$? Test at the 0.05 level of significance. A random sample of $19$ dolphins resulted in a mean of $4.4 \mu g/g$ and a standard deviation of $2.3 \mu g/g$.
