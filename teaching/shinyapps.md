## Shiny Apps

Here is a collection of Shiny Apps I've written. I've also included a link to the GitHub repo, should you want the original code.

### Teaching Tools

- <a href="https://lgpcappiello.shinyapps.io/SimulateCLT/">Simulating the Central Limit Theorem</a>
- <a href="https://lgpcappiello.shinyapps.io/NormalApproxBinom/">Visualizing the Normal Approximation to the Binomial Distribution</a>

### Just For Fun

- <a href="https://lgpcappiello.shinyapps.io/charactergenerator/">Character Generator</a>

## Simulation Code

Here is some additional simulation code that hasn't made it into Shiny Apps yet.

- <a href="https://github.com/lgpcappiello/shinyapps/blob/master/consistency.R">Simulating consistency with a fair coin</a>

<a href="https://github.com/lgpcappiello/shinyapps">Here is the GitHub Repository with all of my Shiny Apps (including one or two under development)</a>
