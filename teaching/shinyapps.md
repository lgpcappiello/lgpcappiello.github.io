## Shiny Apps

Here is a collection of Shiny Apps I've written, some for teaching and some just for fun. I've also included a link to the GitHub repo, should you want the original code.

- [**Simulating the Central Limit Theorem**]("https://lgpcappiello.shinyapps.io/SimulateCLT/")
- [**Character Generator**]("https://lgpcappiello.shinyapps.io/charactergenerator/")

[Here is the GitHub Repository with all of my Shiny Apps (including one or two under development)]("https://github.com/lgpcappiello/shinyapps").
