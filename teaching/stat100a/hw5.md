Recall: Homeworks are not to be turned in, but your quiz questions will come directly from your homework assignment. If you make sure you have a thorough understanding of how to answer each question, you will do well on your quiz! :)

Section 6.1 (pg 214) #6.3, 6.7, 6.13

Section 6.2 (pg 225) #6.29

Section 7.1 (pg 259) #7.1, 7.7, 7.11

Wherever you are asked to find and use a p-value, feel free to use the test statistic approach instead!
