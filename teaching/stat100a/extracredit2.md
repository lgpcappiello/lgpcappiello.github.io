## Extra credit

Write an exam question that would be appropriate for your final exam. This question should be fairly rigorous. The final exam will be cumulative, but your question must come from material covered in Chapters 4, 5, 6.1, 6.2, or 7.1 of your textbook. Your question may be either multiple choice or short answer. To receive full credit, *you must write an original question* and you must provide the solution. Where appropriate, you must show your work - this work may be submitted in the form of a scan or photo of your handwritten solution. 

Your completed exam question must be submitted on iLearn ("Final Exam Extra Credit" under "Assignments") by 11:59PM on August 26. 

Note: extra credit will be applied to your final exam score.
