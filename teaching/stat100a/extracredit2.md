## Extra credit

Write an exam question that would be appropriate for your final exam. The final exam will be comprehensive, but will focus on material from Chapters 4-7 of your textbook. Your extra credit exam question must come from material covered in Chapters 4-7. (The course calendar lists specific sections.) Questions may be either multiple choice or short answer. To recieve any credit, *you must write an original question* and provide both the question and the correct answer.

Email your completed exam question to Lauren at lauren.cappiello@email.ucr.edu by midnight on August 26. 

Note: extra credit will be applied to your final exam score.
