## Extra credit

Write three exam questions that would be appropriate for your final exam. These should be fairly rigorous questions. The final exam will be on Chapters 4-6 of your textbook. Your extra credit exam question must come from material related to these chapters. Questions may be either multiple choice or short answer. To receive full credit, *you must write original questions* and you must provide the correct answers. Where appropriate, you must show your work - this work may be submitted in the form of a scan or photo of handwritten solutions. 

Your completed exam question must be submitted on iLearn ("Final Exam Extra Credit" under "Assignments") by 11:59PM on August 26. 

Note: extra credit will be applied to your final exam score.
