## Extra credit

Write an exam question that would be appropriate for your final exam. The final exam will be comprehensive, but will focus on material from Chapters 4-7 of your textbook. Your extra credit exam question must come from material covered in Chapters 4-7. (The course calendar lists specific sections.) Questions may be either multiple choice or short answer. To recieve any credit, *you must write an original question* and provide both the question and the correct answer.

Your completed exam question must be submitted on iLearn ("Final Exam Extra Credit" under "Assignments") by 11:59PM on August 26. 

Note: extra credit will be applied to your final exam score.
