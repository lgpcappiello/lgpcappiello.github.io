## Extra credit

Write an exam question that would be appropriate for your midterm. The midterm will cover material up to and including Section 3.5 of your textbook. Your exam question must come from material covered in class, your homeworks, or your labs. Questions may be either multiple choice or short answer. To recieve any credit, *you must write an original question* and provide both the question and the correct answer.

Your completed exam question must be submitted on iLearn ("Midterm Extra Credit" under "Assignments") by 11:59PM on August 8. 

Note: extra credit will be applied to your midterm score.
