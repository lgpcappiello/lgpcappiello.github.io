# Consulting

## Lead Consultant
## Graduate Quantitative Methods Center at UC Riverside 
### July 2018 -- June 2019

<a href="https://gradquant.ucr.edu/" target="blank">UCR GradQuant</a> works with graduate students and postdoctoral research from all departments to provide assistance in quantitative and computational methods. Consultations include both course support and research assistance. While at GradQuant I worked on questions related to all of my consultation offerings, as well as a number of problems related to SPSS, Stata, Excel, and general programming logic. I also developed and presented workshops, instructional labs, and departmental seminars on statistics and statistical computing. As the lead consultant, I supervised and managed a team of part-time consultants. I also piloted the instructional labs program, and assisted with administrative tasks such as hiring, scheduling, and website management.
