## Lead Consultant
### Graduate Quantitative Methods Center at UC Riverside 
#### July 2018 -- June 2019

<a href="https://gradquant.ucr.edu/" target="blank">UCR GradQuant</a> works with graduate students and postdoctoral research from all departments to provide assistance in quantitative and computational methods. Consultations were primarily research-focused but also included graduate-level course tutoring. While at GradQuant, I worked on problems related to all of my consultation offerings, as well as a number of problems related to SPSS, Stata, Excel, and general programming logic. I also developed and presented workshops, piloted the instructional labs program, and gave departmental seminars on statistics and statistical computing. Finally, I supervised and managed a team of part-time consultants.
